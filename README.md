## Problem Statement:-

Elderly individuals often face mobility, health, and social challenges that make daily activities difficult. This system bridges the gap by offering organized support through volunteers and helpful reminders, improving their quality of life and promoting independence.

<br>

## Objectives:-

- Match elderly citizens with volunteers based on specific needs
- Provide timely medication reminders
- Organize daily tasks with deadlines and reminders
- Encourage community engagement and support
- Simplify technology for ease of use by the elderly

<br>

## Tech Stack:-

- **Language:** Python
- **Modules Used:** `datetime`, `time`, `os`
- **Data Storage:** In-memory using `lists` and `dictionaries`
- **Interface:** Text-based menu system

<br>

## Future Enhancements:-

- Build a working interface for the project for easier usability
- Mobile app version with GUI
- Location-based volunteer-citizen pairing
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Push notifications for reminders
- Advanced task features (recurring tasks, priorities)
